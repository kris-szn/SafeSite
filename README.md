# SafeSite
Chrome extension for safe browsing.

The most important feature is to support the user when using the online banking. 
The extension ensures that it is really the bank site and only then displays the "green light".
User should never provide his bank account credentials if he does not see that "green light".

The idea behind the extension base on the fact that the number of banks is fairly small, so there can be a white list of banking sites. So no complex logic, no AI etc. Just a straightforward list. 

The extension protects the user from malicious sites (usually sent via phishing mails) which just pretend to be a real banking site and steal the credentials.
